# Aviation Merit Badge – Quick FAQ: VFR Sectional Symbols (one page)

Name: ____________________________   Date: ____________

This is a quick, scout-friendly cheat sheet for common VFR sectional chart symbols. For the official reference (and updates), search: **FAA “Aeronautical Chart Users’ Guide”**.

## 1) Airports & runways: what does the airport symbol tell me?

**Q: Why are some airport symbols blue and some magenta?**
- **Blue airport symbol** = airport has an **operating control tower** (towered) *at least some of the time*.
- **Magenta airport symbol** = **non-towered** airport.

**Q: What do the little runway drawings mean?**
- The runway “diagram” is a **mini overhead view** showing the **runway directions/layout**.
- If there’s **no runway diagram** (just a small airport mark), it’s typically a **very small field**; details like runway length/surface are in the **Chart Supplement**.

**Q: What does “RP” mean near a runway?**
- **RP = Right traffic** for that runway (airplanes fly the traffic pattern with right turns instead of the usual left turns).

**Q: How do I know if the airport has fuel?**
- On many sectionals, **airport name color** is a fast hint:
  - **Blue name** often indicates **fuel available**.
  - **Magenta name** often indicates **no fuel**.
- When in doubt (or for specifics), check the **Chart Supplement**.

## 2) The “star” (and the “asterisk”): what do they mean?

**Q: What does a star on/near an airport mean?**
- A **star** by an airport is commonly used to indicate a **rotating beacon** (the green/white airport beacon) is present/used at night.
- Practical takeaway: if you’re looking for the airport after dark, the beacon can be the easiest thing to spot.

**Q: I see an asterisk (*) by a tower frequency or airport info—what’s that?**
- An **asterisk (*)** often flags **part-time** service (for example, a tower that is not staffed 24/7).
- Practical takeaway: check the **Chart Supplement** for the **hours**.

## 3) Frequencies: what should I look for first?

**Q: What’s the first frequency to find at a non-towered airport?**
- **CTAF** (Common Traffic Advisory Frequency): used to announce position/intentions.
- **UNICOM**: a “general” airport frequency that is often the CTAF; may also reach someone on the field.

**Q: What frequencies are common at towered airports?**
- **ATIS / AWOS / ASOS**: automated weather (listen first if available).
- **TWR** (Tower): takeoff/landing/runway instructions.
- **GND** (Ground): taxi instructions.
- **APP/DEP** (Approach/Departure): radar services around busier areas.

**Q: Where are these printed?**
- Usually **next to the airport name/symbol**.
- Towered airports may show multiple frequencies grouped together; non-towered airports often show a **single main frequency** (CTAF/UNICOM).

**Always worth knowing:** 121.5 MHz is the VHF emergency frequency (“Guard”) for aircraft.

## 4) Airspace lines (quick visual decoding)

**Q: What do the colored rings/lines usually mean?**
- **Class B**: solid **blue** rings.
- **Class C**: solid **magenta** rings.
- **Class D**: **dashed blue** circle around the airport.
- **Class E (surface)**: **dashed magenta** boundary.

**Q: What do the numbers like 45/12 mean?**
- Think **ceiling / floor**, in **hundreds of feet MSL**.
- Example: **45/12** means “top is **4,500 ft MSL**, bottom is **1,200 ft MSL**.”

---

## 5) Obstacles & towers: what am I looking at?

**Q: Why do some towers have two numbers?**
- Many obstacles show:
  - **Top elevation MSL** (feet above sea level), and
  - **Height AGL** (feet above the ground).

**Q: Why do some obstacles look ‘emphasized’?**
- Charts highlight obstacles that are especially significant for low-altitude flight; some are shown as lighted vs unlighted.
- Practical takeaway: use the numbers (MSL/AGL) to understand how tall it really is in your area.

## 6) If you’re unsure (safe, quick workflow)

1) Identify the symbol on the chart.
2) Check the **Chart Supplement** for the airport’s exact details (runways, lighting, hours, pattern notes, services).
3) If you’re actually flying: use current charts and check NOTAMs.
