# Instructor Guide – Session 2A (90 minutes): Drone activity / guidance

Primary coverage: Requirement 2 (drone option)
Secondary coverage: complete any missing pieces of Requirement 1

## Session outcomes

By the end, most scouts can:

- Demonstrate safe behavior around a drone/model aircraft.
- Explain how a drone demonstrates the four forces of flight (especially thrust/lift and drag).
- Complete (or have a plan to complete) TRUST for recreational drone flying.
- Log a supervised successful takeoff and landing.

## Safety philosophy (consistent across instructors)

- Flight is optional; safety participation is required.
- Any scout can opt out of “hands on controller” and still participate as observer/recorder.
- One clear rule: if anything feels unsafe, **LAND**.

## Recommended pre-work (helps pacing)

Ask scouts to do these before Session 2:

- Complete TRUST (required to fly under the drone option).
- Fill out sections A–C of `handouts/req-2-drone-safety-flight-log.md`.

If you’re also covering Requirement 5 in class, assign:

- Skim `handouts/req-5-opportunities-handout.md` and pick one career to research later.
- Instructor reference: see `instructor-notes/instructor-guide-session-2-requirement-5.md`.

## 0:00–0:10 – Welcome + recap

### Talking points

- Quick recap prompts:
  - “Name the four forces.”
  - “What do ailerons/elevator/rudder do?”
- Preview: today is applying those principles to a real flying system.

---

## 0:10–0:22 – Safety briefing + roles

### What to cover

- Visual line of sight (VLOS) at all times.
- No flight over people.
- Defined flight boundary (“flight box”).
- Slow, smooth inputs; no stunts.
- Immediate compliance with safety marshal.
- Emergency actions:
  - If boundary is violated or person enters: hover → land
  - If control is lost: cut throttle/land as trained (use your drone’s safe procedure)

### Roles (single flight line)

Roles rotate each time a new pilot flies:

- Pilot: hands on controls
- Visual observer: watches drone + environment, calls out hazards
- Safety marshal: watches boundary and people
- Recorder: logs attempts, notes conditions

### Consistency note

- Use the same callouts each time:
  - “Taking off” / “Landing” / “Abort” / “Clear”

---

## 0:22–0:30 – TRUST check + expectations

### What to cover

- Explain TRUST in plain language:
  - It’s a recreational safety knowledge test/cert for drone pilots.
- Check who has a certificate.

### If scouts don’t have TRUST

- They can be observer/recorder today.
- Schedule a follow-up flight after they complete TRUST.

---

## 0:30–0:45 – Instructor-led briefing before you go outside

Goal: deliver all teaching content before the flight portion.

### Preflight + systems (group instruction)

Talking points:
- Preflight is normal aviation practice (real planes do it every flight).
- What you will check every time:
  - Battery level and secure mounting
  - Props/guards condition
  - Controller link / signal
  - Home point / return-to-home awareness (if applicable)
  - Clear takeoff/landing zone

Bridge to Requirement 1 concepts:
- Reliability and inspection prevent emergencies.

### Controls and “airmanship” (group instruction)

Talking points:
- Controls map to aircraft motion:
  - Throttle: changes lift/thrust available
  - Yaw: rotates heading
  - Pitch/roll: tilt changes direction; tilt trades vertical lift for horizontal motion
- Emphasize “small inputs, pause, observe.”

Common misconception:
- New pilots “over-correct” and induce oscillations. Teach: input → wait → adjust.

### Define success (consistent sign-off standard)

Define what “successful” means for your session:
- Safe takeoff
- Controlled hover for a few seconds (or a slow simple maneuver)
- Safe landing in the zone

---

## Walk time and boundary setup (plan it explicitly)

Budget ~10 minutes total for:

- Walking from classroom to flight area
- Marking the boundary / flight box
- Putting observers behind a clear line
- One last “LAND if unsafe” reminder

---

## Flight portion (single instructor, single flight line)

### How to run it with 12 scouts

- Keep one active pilot at a time.
- Rotate roles every pilot.
- Give each pilot a short, repeatable pattern:
  - Takeoff → hover 3–5 seconds → land
- If time allows, a second attempt or a slow square pattern.

### Coaching script (not word-for-word, but consistent)

- “Tiny throttle changes.”
- “Fix one thing at a time.”
- “If you drift: stop, level, then correct.”

### Tie to flight principles (keep it short; you already taught this)

Use quick callouts while observing, not a long lecture:

- Tilt forward = some lift becomes horizontal motion
- More speed = more drag
- Wind = drift + extra corrections

---

## After flight (keep instructor-led content minimal)

### Sign-offs

- Confirm who completed safe takeoff + controlled flight + safe landing.
- Note who needs follow-up (often due to TRUST not completed or time limits).

### Close-out (30–60 seconds)

- Point scouts to the Req 5 handout for deeper career research during the week (if assigned).

---

## 1:35–1:40 – Close + follow-up visit pitch

### What to cover

- Airport/tower/ARTCC visits are optional follow-ups for Requirements 3–4 (depending on what scouts choose).
- Give clear expectations:
  - Schedule constraints
  - Behavior and safety
  - Identification/photo rules (facility dependent)

---

## Backup plans (if drone can’t fly)

Pick one and still keep the safety + debrief structure:

- FPG-9 paper gliders with a landing accuracy contest
- Rubber-band balsa plane flight distance challenge

Tie-back talking points:
- You still observe forces, stability, trim-like adjustments, and glide ratio concepts.
