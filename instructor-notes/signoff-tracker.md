# Aviation Merit Badge – Sign-off Tracker (Template)

Use this to track which scouts completed which parts during class and which need follow-up.

## Roster

| Scout name | Req 1 complete? | Req 2 option chosen | Req 2 complete? | Req 5 complete? | Notes / follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 6 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 7 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 8 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 9 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 10 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 11 |  |  |  |  |  |
| 12 |  |  |  |  |  |

## Notes

- Consider using initials/dates in the cells (e.g., `AW 1/30`).
- If a scout completes Req 2 by a different option (FPG-9 or balsa), record that in the “option chosen” column.
