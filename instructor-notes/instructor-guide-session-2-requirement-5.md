# Instructor Guide – Requirement 5 module (30–45 minutes)

Use this as an add-on to Session 2 (or a standalone classroom segment) to complete or substantially advance Requirement 5.

This module aligns to `requirements.md` Requirement 5 and uses the scout worksheet `handouts/req-5-opportunities-handout.md`.

## Outcomes

By the end, most scouts can:

- Explain (in simple terms) what each certificate/rating is for: student, recreational, private, remote pilot; instrument rating; commercial, ATP, CFI.
- Name at least one local youth aviation organization (Exploring Post and/or CAP) and what it does.
- Identify three aviation careers and choose one to research.

## Materials

- `handouts/req-5-opportunities-handout.md` (recommended: one per scout)
- Optional: internet access (phone + parent permission) or printed pages you bring
- Whiteboard/markers

## Ground rules (keep it accurate and scout-friendly)

- Use “plain language” definitions; avoid legal fine print.
- Say “rules change” and encourage checking FAA/AOPA for current details.
- This is not flight training; it’s an overview of pathways.

## Key terms (certificate vs rating vs endorsement)

Scouts often hear these words used interchangeably—this quick framework keeps it straight.

- **Certificate** = the FAA credential you *hold* (your “level” or “license”).
  - Examples: student pilot certificate, recreational pilot certificate, private pilot certificate, commercial pilot certificate, airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate, remote pilot certificate (Part 107), flight instructor certificate (CFI).
- **Rating** = an additional *privilege label* attached to a pilot certificate that expands what you can do in certain aircraft or conditions.
  - Examples scouts will hear: **instrument rating**; category/class ratings like **airplane single-engine land**.
  - Plain-language: “Ratings add capabilities; they don’t replace the certificate.”
- **Endorsement** = a specific instructor sign-off in a logbook that authorizes a particular activity or additional privilege (often for a limited scenario).
  - Examples: first solo endorsement, night training endorsement (as applicable), tailwheel endorsement, complex/high-performance endorsement.

Instructor phrasing tip:
- “Certificate = permission level, rating = extra capability, endorsement = instructor sign-off for a specific privilege.”

Quick translation for the “what airplane can I fly?” question:
- Most pilot certificates are only valid for the **aircraft category/class/type** you’re rated for (example: airplane single-engine land). Bigger/faster/more complex airplanes may require additional endorsements or a type rating.

### How you add new airplane categories/classes (ratings)

This is the “how do I fly a different kind of aircraft?” pathway.

- **Category rating** = broad kind of aircraft (examples: **airplane**, **rotorcraft**, **glider**).
- **Class rating** = subgroup inside a category (examples for airplanes: **single-engine land**, **multiengine land**).
- **Type rating** = specific aircraft model for many large or turbojet airplanes (example: a specific jet type).

How pilots usually earn an additional category/class rating (plain language):
- Get training from an instructor in that category/class.
- Meet the experience/training requirements.
- Take a practical test (“checkride”) in that category/class.

Simple examples you can say out loud:
- “Private Pilot (Airplane Single-Engine Land) → add **Multiengine Land** class rating → now you’re rated for multiengine airplanes too.”
- “Airplane pilot → add **Rotorcraft/Helicopter** category/class rating → now you can fly helicopters (with the right rating).”

## Choose the version that fits your time

- **10-minute “preview only” (fast):** cover TRUST vs Part 107, then *one* airplane pathway (student → private → instrument), then assign the handout as take-home.
- **30-minute “in-class start”:** cover all certificates/ratings at a high level + have scouts pick 3 careers and start one research box.
- **45-minute “most of Req 5 in class”:** add the activities and do short 1–2 sentence verbal check-offs for each scout.

---

## Suggested pacing

### Optional pacing (stretch/compress on demand)

- **If you’re short on time:** skip the activities and jump straight to “Careers: choose 3, research 1.”
- **If you need filler (5–10 minutes):** run one activity (below) + do a round of “one-sentence explanations” for sign-off.

### Optional activities (high value, no extra materials)

- **Activity A – Pathway ladder (3–5 min)**
  - On the board, draw a ladder:
    - Student → Private → Instrument Rating → Commercial → ATP
    - Add a separate box off to the side: Remote Pilot (Part 107)
  - Ask: “Which of these is *a rating*, not a certificate?” (Instrument)
  - Ask: “Which one is the common pathway for paid airline captain jobs?” (ATP)

- **Activity B – Match the credential to the scenario (3–6 min)**
  - Read a scenario; scouts call out what credential is most relevant.
  - Scenarios you can use:
    - “I want to learn with an instructor and eventually fly solo.” (Student)
    - “I want to fly my family on a weekend trip for fun.” (Private)
    - “I want to fly in clouds using instruments and procedures.” (Instrument rating)
    - “I want to fly a drone for a real estate business.” (Remote pilot / Part 107)
    - “I want a job flying airplanes for pay.” (Commercial)
    - “I want to be an airline captain someday.” (ATP)

- **Activity C – One-sentence check-offs (5–10 min)**
  - Go down the row; each scout answers 1–2 items out loud in one sentence.
  - Rotate which item each scout gets so it stays quick.

### 0:00–0:03 – Frame the pathway

- Prompt: “What jobs exist in aviation besides ‘airline pilot’?”
- Key idea: aviation is a system (pilots, mechanics, controllers, dispatchers, engineers, airport ops, drone operators).

Optional hooks (pick one):
- “Aviation is a team sport: one flight can involve pilots, mechanics, dispatchers, controllers, and airport staff.”
- “Two big branches today: crewed aircraft and drones—both need trained, safety-minded operators.”

### 0:03–0:15 – Pilot certificates (Part 61) and what they allow

Use Section A of the handout.

- **Student pilot certificate**
  - Plain-language: “The starting credential that lets you train with an instructor and (eventually) fly solo under specific rules.”
  - Why it matters: “It’s the first official step in the airplane pilot pathway.”
  - Talking points (restrictions/affordances):
    - Training focus: you fly with an instructor while building skills.
    - **Solo** happens only after an instructor endorsement; solo privileges are limited to what the instructor authorizes.
    - Solo means **you are the only person onboard** (no passengers).
    - Where/when you can solo is limited (airport area, routes, and conditions approved by the instructor).
    - You’re learning the “system”: radios, airspace basics, checklists, weather go/no-go.
    - Airplane limits (plain-language):
      - You can solo only in the **specific make/model** your instructor endorses, and that endorsement must be kept current.
      - Outside of solo (with an instructor onboard), you can train in whatever aircraft your instructor is qualified to teach in.

Instructor phrasing tip:
- Keep it simple: “Student = training + first solo (with your instructor’s sign-off).”

- **Recreational pilot certificate**
  - Plain-language: “A pilot certificate meant for local, just-for-fun flying—more privileges than a student pilot, but more limits than a private pilot.”
  - Why it matters: “It’s a real certificate with real privileges, but it’s intentionally restricted.”
  - Talking points (restrictions/affordances):
    - Passenger limits:
      - May carry **no more than one passenger**.
    - Airplane limits (common headline restrictions):
      - Typically limited to **simple single-engine airplanes**: one engine, fixed landing gear, and not more than 180 horsepower.
      - Typically limited to airplanes certificated for **no more than four occupants**.
    - Other common operating limits (helpful context):
      - Generally **daytime VFR** only and generally local-area flying without additional endorsements.
      - No flying for compensation or hire.

Optional note (only if asked):
- Some people also talk about **sport pilot** as another limited pathway; the key idea is the same: “limited privileges compared to private.”

- **Private pilot certificate**
  - Plain-language: “The most common ‘I can fly an airplane for personal reasons’ certificate.”
  - Typical use: family trips, volunteering flights, personal travel.
  - Safety mindset: “It requires training, testing, and ongoing good judgment.”
  - Talking points (restrictions/affordances):
    - Passenger limits:
      - No fixed passenger number limit in the certificate itself—limited by the **aircraft’s seats**, weight/balance, and safety.
      - Not allowed to carry passengers **for compensation or hire** (with limited exceptions).
    - Airplane limits:
      - You may fly the airplanes you’re **rated for** (category/class/type as applicable).
      - Some aircraft require extra sign-offs (endorsements) like **tailwheel**, **complex**, or **high-performance**.
    - You can generally fly **cross-country** and use a wider range of airports.
    - You can add capabilities via endorsements (e.g., complex/high-performance aircraft) and ratings (e.g., instrument).
    - “Private” doesn’t mean “anytime/anywhere”—weather, aircraft limits, and regulations still apply.

Quick reality-check (30 seconds):
- “Private pilot is about *privileges and responsibility*—not ‘flying whenever you want.’ Weather, rules, and safety still apply.”

- **Remote pilot certificate (drone / Part 107)**
  - Plain-language: “The FAA certificate for certain drone work (often when you’re flying for a business or job).”
  - Tie-back to Session 2: “TRUST is for recreational flyers; Part 107 is the common work/business pathway.”
  - Talking points (restrictions/affordances):
    - Lets you conduct many **non-recreational** drone operations (work, school projects, volunteering, paid jobs) under Part 107.
    - Still has operating limits (common ones scouts hear): **visual line of sight**, altitude limits, and **airspace authorization** for controlled airspace.
    - Rules for operations **at night** and **over people/vehicles** depend on training/requirements and the specific operation.
    - There are **waivers** for some operations when you can show an equivalent level of safety.
    - You must stay current via FAA recurrent training/testing requirements.

Optional clarification:
- “TRUST = recreational safety knowledge. Part 107 remote pilot = common credential for non-recreational drone operations.”

Quick check prompts:
- “Which one is for drone work?”
- “Which one is the most common for personal airplane flying?”

Common misconceptions to address (if needed):
- “TRUST means I can do any drone job.” → TRUST is for recreational flying; work often needs Part 107.
- “Private pilot means you can fly in clouds.” → That’s where instrument training/rating matters.

### 0:15–0:20 – Instrument rating (why it matters)

Use Section B of the handout.

- Plain-language: “An instrument rating teaches you to fly using instruments and procedures when you can’t rely on outside visual references.”
- Benefits (simple):
  - Safer decision-making and weather options (with training and limits)
  - More consistent navigation and communication
  - Builds discipline and confidence
  - Talking points (restrictions/affordances):
    - It’s a **rating**, not a certificate: it attaches to your pilot certificate.
    - Enables flying under **IFR** (Instrument Flight Rules) when properly equipped, current, and legal.
    - Adds structured procedures (clearances, approaches, alternate planning) and reduces “press-on-itis.”
    - It doesn’t make weather “safe” by itself—minimums, icing/thunderstorms, and aircraft capability still matter.

Mini-story you can tell (30–45 seconds):
- “Lots of accidents start with ‘we thought we could stay VFR.’ Instrument training is about making good decisions and having the skills to use the system safely.”

Prompt:
- “Why might ‘flying by instruments’ be hard?” (trusting instruments, workload, weather)

Quick check:
- “Instrument rating: certificate or rating?” (Rating)

### 0:20–0:28 – Professional certificates

Use Section C of the handout.

- **Commercial pilot certificate**
  - Plain-language: “A certificate that allows certain paid flying jobs (with additional rules and requirements).”
  - Talking points (restrictions/affordances):
    - Passenger limits:
      - Can carry passengers **for compensation or hire** when you’re qualified and the operation meets the applicable FAA rules.
      - Important nuance: some kinds of “paid passenger flying” require additional operator requirements beyond just the pilot certificate.
      - If you don’t hold an instrument rating in the same category/class, your certificate may include a limitation that restricts carrying passengers for hire **at night** or on longer cross-country flights.
    - Airplane limits:
      - Like private, it’s still limited to the **aircraft ratings/type ratings** you hold.
    - It’s a step toward many careers: instruction, corporate, aerial work, and airline pathways.

Examples of ‘paid flying’ jobs (pick 1–2):
- Aerial photography
- Banner towing
- Flight instruction (with instructor certificate)
- Charter/corporate pathways (varies by operator)

- **Airline Transport Pilot (ATP)**
  - Plain-language: “The top pilot certificate level for airline captains and many airline jobs.”
  - Talking points (restrictions/affordances):
    - Passenger limits:
      - No special passenger-number “cap” in the certificate itself—limits come from the **aircraft**, company procedures, and the operating rules.
    - Airplane limits:
      - ATP privileges apply only to the **category/class/type** you’re rated in (big jets require a **type rating**).
    - Often required to serve as **captain (PIC)** in airline/transport roles.
    - Has higher experience and knowledge requirements than commercial.
    - Think of it as “professional airline-level standards and responsibilities.”

Instructor phrasing tip:
- “ATP is the ‘top rung’ for airline pilots.”

- **Certified Flight Instructor (CFI)**
  - Plain-language: “A pilot who is authorized to teach others to fly and sign training logs.”
  - Why it matters: “Many professional pilots become CFIs to build experience and help others.”
  - Talking points (restrictions/affordances):
    - A CFI can give training and provide **endorsements** (logbook sign-offs) when appropriate.
    - Teaching is a core aviation safety role: “you’re responsible for building good habits.”
    - Airplane limits (instructor-specific):
      - A CFI can only teach in aircraft categories/classes (and type ratings, if needed) that the instructor is qualified and rated in.
    - Passenger limits (training context):
      - In most training flights, it’s just the instructor and the learner; extra passengers generally aren’t part of the training mission.

Common misconception:
- “CFI is ‘less than’ airline.” → Many airline pilots were CFIs; it’s a key teaching and experience-building role.

### 0:28–0:33 – Youth organizations (local opportunities)

Use Section D of the handout.

- **Aviation Exploring Post**
  - Plain-language: “A youth program where you can learn aviation skills, visit facilities, and meet mentors.”

- **Civil Air Patrol (CAP)**
  - Plain-language: “A youth program focused on aerospace education, leadership, and (for older members) emergency services.”

How to make this easy in the room (1–2 minutes):
- Ask scouts to write down “1 org to check” and “what I hope to do there.”
- If internet use is allowed: have them search with a parent later and fill Section D as take-home.

Prompt:
- “What would you want to do in a youth aviation program—hands-on projects, airport visits, flight lessons, drones?”

### 0:33–0:45 – Careers: choose 3, research 1

Use Section E of the handout.

- Give 2 minutes: scouts list 3 careers.
- Give 5–8 minutes: scouts pick 1 and start filling the research boxes.
- If you’re short on time: assign the research as take-home, and collect it next meeting.

Helpful constraints (keep it scout-friendly and realistic):
- Encourage “good-faith estimates,” not perfect numbers.
- For salary/outlook: use sources like BLS/O*NET rather than random blogs.

Quick prompts that produce better answers:
- “What do they do on a normal day?”
- “What training comes first?”
- “What’s one thing that would make this job stressful?”
- “What’s one thing that would make it rewarding?”

## Counselor sign-off guidance (simple)

- Use the handout as the record of completion.
- For “explain” requirements: have each scout answer out loud in one or two sentences.
- For the career research: ensure the scout used reliable sources and wrote in their own words.
