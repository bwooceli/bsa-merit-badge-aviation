# Instructor Guide – Requirement 5 module (30–45 minutes)

Use this as an add-on to Session 2 (or a standalone classroom segment) to complete or substantially advance Requirement 5.

This module aligns to `requirements.md` Requirement 5 and uses the scout worksheet `handouts/req-5-opportunities-handout.md`.

## Outcomes

By the end, most scouts can:

- Explain (in simple terms) what each certificate/rating is for: student, recreational, private, remote pilot; instrument rating; commercial, ATP, CFI.
- Name at least one local youth aviation organization (Exploring Post and/or CAP) and what it does.
- Identify three aviation careers and choose one to research.

## Materials

- `handouts/req-5-opportunities-handout.md` (recommended: one per scout)
- Optional: internet access (phone + parent permission) or printed pages you bring
- Whiteboard/markers

## Ground rules (keep it accurate and scout-friendly)

- Use “plain language” definitions; avoid legal fine print.
- Say “rules change” and encourage checking FAA/AOPA for current details.
- This is not flight training; it’s an overview of pathways.

## Choose the version that fits your time

- **10-minute “preview only” (fast):** cover TRUST vs Part 107, then *one* airplane pathway (student → private → instrument), then assign the handout as take-home.
- **30-minute “in-class start”:** cover all certificates/ratings at a high level + have scouts pick 3 careers and start one research box.
- **45-minute “most of Req 5 in class”:** add the activities and do short 1–2 sentence verbal check-offs for each scout.

## Suggested pacing

### Optional pacing (stretch/compress on demand)

- **If you’re short on time:** skip the activities and jump straight to “Careers: choose 3, research 1.”
- **If you need filler (5–10 minutes):** run one activity (below) + do a round of “one-sentence explanations” for sign-off.

### Optional activities (high value, no extra materials)

- **Activity A – Pathway ladder (3–5 min)**
  - On the board, draw a ladder:
    - Student → Private → Instrument Rating → Commercial → ATP
    - Add a separate box off to the side: Remote Pilot (Part 107)
  - Ask: “Which of these is *a rating*, not a certificate?” (Instrument)
  - Ask: “Which one is the common pathway for paid airline captain jobs?” (ATP)

- **Activity B – Match the credential to the scenario (3–6 min)**
  - Read a scenario; scouts call out what credential is most relevant.
  - Scenarios you can use:
    - “I want to learn with an instructor and eventually fly solo.” (Student)
    - “I want to fly my family on a weekend trip for fun.” (Private)
    - “I want to fly in clouds using instruments and procedures.” (Instrument rating)
    - “I want to fly a drone for a real estate business.” (Remote pilot / Part 107)
    - “I want a job flying airplanes for pay.” (Commercial)
    - “I want to be an airline captain someday.” (ATP)

- **Activity C – One-sentence check-offs (5–10 min)**
  - Go down the row; each scout answers 1–2 items out loud in one sentence.
  - Rotate which item each scout gets so it stays quick.

### 0:00–0:03 – Frame the pathway

- Prompt: “What jobs exist in aviation besides ‘airline pilot’?”
- Key idea: aviation is a system (pilots, mechanics, controllers, dispatchers, engineers, airport ops, drone operators).

Optional hooks (pick one):
- “Aviation is a team sport: one flight can involve pilots, mechanics, dispatchers, controllers, and airport staff.”
- “Two big branches today: crewed aircraft and drones—both need trained, safety-minded operators.”

### 0:03–0:15 – Pilot certificates (Part 61) and what they allow

Use Section A of the handout.

- **Student pilot certificate**
  - Plain-language: “The starting credential that lets you train with an instructor and (eventually) fly solo under specific rules.”
  - Why it matters: “It’s the first official step in the airplane pilot pathway.”

Instructor phrasing tip:
- Keep it simple: “Student = training + first solo (with your instructor’s sign-off).”

- **Recreational pilot certificate**
  - Plain-language: “A less common pilot certificate with more limits than a private pilot; created to make a simpler pathway, but fewer people use it today.”
  - Why it matters: “It shows that certificates come with different privileges/limits.”

Instructor phrasing tip:
- If you get questions: “Think of it as a more limited step between student and private.”

- **Private pilot certificate**
  - Plain-language: “The most common ‘I can fly an airplane for personal reasons’ certificate.”
  - Typical use: family trips, volunteering flights, personal travel.
  - Safety mindset: “It requires training, testing, and ongoing good judgment.”

Quick reality-check (30 seconds):
- “Private pilot is about *privileges and responsibility*—not ‘flying whenever you want.’ Weather, rules, and safety still apply.”

- **Remote pilot certificate (drone / Part 107)**
  - Plain-language: “The FAA certificate for certain drone work (often when you’re flying for a business or job).”
  - Tie-back to Session 2: “TRUST is for recreational flyers; Part 107 is the common work/business pathway.”

Optional clarification:
- “TRUST = recreational safety knowledge. Part 107 remote pilot = common credential for non-recreational drone operations.”

Quick check prompts:
- “Which one is for drone work?”
- “Which one is the most common for personal airplane flying?”

Common misconceptions to address (if needed):
- “TRUST means I can do any drone job.” → TRUST is for recreational flying; work often needs Part 107.
- “Private pilot means you can fly in clouds.” → That’s where instrument training/rating matters.

### 0:15–0:20 – Instrument rating (why it matters)

Use Section B of the handout.

- Plain-language: “An instrument rating teaches you to fly using instruments and procedures when you can’t rely on outside visual references.”
- Benefits (simple):
  - Safer decision-making and weather options (with training and limits)
  - More consistent navigation and communication
  - Builds discipline and confidence

Mini-story you can tell (30–45 seconds):
- “Lots of accidents start with ‘we thought we could stay VFR.’ Instrument training is about making good decisions and having the skills to use the system safely.”

Prompt:
- “Why might ‘flying by instruments’ be hard?” (trusting instruments, workload, weather)

Quick check:
- “Instrument rating: certificate or rating?” (Rating)

### 0:20–0:28 – Professional certificates

Use Section C of the handout.

- **Commercial pilot certificate**
  - Plain-language: “A certificate that allows certain paid flying jobs (with additional rules and requirements).”

Examples of ‘paid flying’ jobs (pick 1–2):
- Aerial photography
- Banner towing
- Flight instruction (with instructor certificate)
- Charter/corporate pathways (varies by operator)

- **Airline Transport Pilot (ATP)**
  - Plain-language: “The top pilot certificate level for airline captains and many airline jobs.”

Instructor phrasing tip:
- “ATP is the ‘top rung’ for airline pilots.”

- **Certified Flight Instructor (CFI)**
  - Plain-language: “A pilot who is authorized to teach others to fly and sign training logs.”
  - Why it matters: “Many professional pilots become CFIs to build experience and help others.”

Common misconception:
- “CFI is ‘less than’ airline.” → Many airline pilots were CFIs; it’s a key teaching and experience-building role.

### 0:28–0:33 – Youth organizations (local opportunities)

Use Section D of the handout.

- **Aviation Exploring Post**
  - Plain-language: “A youth program where you can learn aviation skills, visit facilities, and meet mentors.”

- **Civil Air Patrol (CAP)**
  - Plain-language: “A youth program focused on aerospace education, leadership, and (for older members) emergency services.”

How to make this easy in the room (1–2 minutes):
- Ask scouts to write down “1 org to check” and “what I hope to do there.”
- If internet use is allowed: have them search with a parent later and fill Section D as take-home.

Prompt:
- “What would you want to do in a youth aviation program—hands-on projects, airport visits, flight lessons, drones?”

### 0:33–0:45 – Careers: choose 3, research 1

Use Section E of the handout.

- Give 2 minutes: scouts list 3 careers.
- Give 5–8 minutes: scouts pick 1 and start filling the research boxes.
- If you’re short on time: assign the research as take-home, and collect it next meeting.

Helpful constraints (keep it scout-friendly and realistic):
- Encourage “good-faith estimates,” not perfect numbers.
- For salary/outlook: use sources like BLS/O*NET rather than random blogs.

Quick prompts that produce better answers:
- “What do they do on a normal day?”
- “What training comes first?”
- “What’s one thing that would make this job stressful?”
- “What’s one thing that would make it rewarding?”

## Counselor sign-off guidance (simple)

- Use the handout as the record of completion.
- For “explain” requirements: have each scout answer out loud in one or two sentences.
- For the career research: ensure the scout used reliable sources and wrote in their own words.
