# Instructor Guide – Session 1 (90 minutes)

Audience: middle school to early high school

Purpose: deliver a consistent, merit-badge-aligned introduction to aviation basics and the mechanics of flight.

Primary coverage: Requirement 1 (all sub-items)
Optional preview: Requirement 5 (high-level pathway only if ahead)

## Session outcomes (what scouts should be able to do)

By the end, most scouts can:

- Give a plain-language definition of “aircraft” and name multiple aircraft types with common uses.
- Compare fixed-wing vs rotary-wing (benefits + tradeoffs).
- Describe (at a big-picture level) piston vs turbine vs jet engines.
- Explain the four forces of flight and apply them to a simple model.
- Explain lift generation using Bernoulli’s principle + downwash (simple, non-mathy).
- Identify basic control surfaces and match them to pitch/roll/yaw.
- Identify the purpose of typical single-engine aircraft instruments (basic six + nav/comm + engine).

## Instructor tone and level

- Keep explanations concrete and example-based.
- Use “pilot language” but define terms immediately.
- Avoid deep physics; aim for correct intuition and safety-minded thinking.

## Materials notes

- If you do not have a model airplane, a printed diagram still works.
- If you do not have a projector, use the board and the handout.

---

## 0:00–0:10 – Icebreaker + expectations

### Talking points

- Set a respectful, curious tone: “There are no bad questions in aviation.”
- Explain the structure: Session 1 classroom basics; Session 2 hands-on flight principles (drone/model).

### Prompts (fast)

- “What aircraft have you been in or seen up close?”
- “What do you think a pilot watches during takeoff?”

### Consistency note

- Keep icebreaker to 10 minutes—this is the most common pace risk.

---

## 0:10–0:20 – Aircraft definition + types

### What to cover

- **Definition of aircraft (plain language):** a machine that flies by being supported by air (using lift or rotor thrust).
- **Three categories of aircraft today** (examples + uses). You can use:
  - Fixed-wing airplane (training, transport, cargo)
  - Rotary-wing helicopter (EMS, rescue, lifting)
  - Other: glider, balloon, jet airliner, drone/UAS, seaplane

### Optional pacing (fills the full 10 minutes)

- **0:10–0:12 – Define it + boundaries (2 min)**
  - Ask: “Is a rocket an aircraft?” (Let them answer; then: rockets don’t rely on air for support—different category.)
  - Ask: “Is a flying squirrel an aircraft?” (No—living thing, not a machine.)
  - Quick re-say: “An aircraft is a *machine* that can fly by being supported by air.”

- **0:12–0:16 – Three categories + one ‘job’ each (4 min)**
  - **Fixed-wing:** best at going far efficiently.
  - **Rotary-wing:** best at hovering/precise low-speed work.
  - **Other:** special cases (no engine, lighter-than-air, water operations, unmanned).
  - Prompt: “If you had to do a rescue from a mountain, which type and why?”
  - Prompt: “If you had to move people across the country, which type and why?”

- **0:16–0:19 – ‘Name it, type it, use it’ game (3 min)**
  - Call out an example and have scouts answer as a group: **type** + **one use**.
  - Use this list (mix easy + surprising):
    - Cessna 172 (fixed-wing; training)
    - Cargo plane (fixed-wing; freight)
    - Medical helicopter (rotary-wing; EMS)
    - Coast Guard helicopter (rotary-wing; rescue)
    - Hot air balloon (other; tourism/weather)
    - Glider (other; training/aerodynamics)
    - Drone/UAS (other; inspection/search)
    - Seaplane (other; access to lakes/islands)

- **0:19–0:20 – Misconceptions + quick wrap (1 min)**
  - Misconception: “Helicopters don’t have wings.” → Rotor blades are rotating wings.
  - Misconception: “Drones aren’t aircraft.” → They are aircraft (unmanned) when they fly.
  - Bridge to next section: “Different aircraft types exist because people need different jobs done.”

### Examples to mention

- Why training airplanes are often small fixed-wing piston aircraft.
- Why helicopters are chosen for point-to-point access (hover/vertical).

### Quick check

- Ask each scout to name one aircraft + one use.

## 0:20–0:30 – Evolution of flight (3 notable moments)

### What to cover (choose 3)

Pick three milestones and explain why each mattered.

- **Balloons / lighter-than-air flight:** first human flight, different lift mechanism (buoyancy).
- **Wright-era controlled powered flight:** control + powered propulsion + repeatable flight.
- **Jets / turbine era:** speed/altitude/range jump; modern airline travel.

### Optional pacing (fills the full 10 minutes)

- **0:20–0:21 – Set the frame (1 min)**
  - “We’re going to pick 3 moments that changed what humans could do in the air.”
  - “Your take-home asks you to name the 3 moments and say why each mattered.”

- **0:21–0:28 – Three mini-stories (7 min total)**
  - Tell each as a 60–90 second story with a clear “why it mattered” sentence.
  - After each story, ask: “What changed because of this?”

- **0:28–0:30 – Quick check + tie-forward (2 min)**
  - Have scouts pair up and say their 3 moments + why (30 seconds each), then call on 1–2 pairs.
  - Bridge line: “Next we’ll compare *types* of aircraft that grew out of these ideas.”

### Ready-to-use historical examples (short, story-driven)

- **Balloons / lighter-than-air (late 1700s)**
  - Example story: “In 1783, the Montgolfier brothers launched one of the first successful hot-air balloons in France. It proved humans could leave the ground and stay aloft—using buoyancy, not wings.”
  - Why it mattered (one-liner): “It opened the door to human flight and showed there’s more than one way to get lift.”
  - Prompt: “How is a balloon’s ‘lift’ different from an airplane’s lift?”

- **Wright-era controlled powered flight (early 1900s)**
  - Example story: “In 1903, the Wright brothers didn’t just ‘hop’ into the air—they solved *control*: keeping the aircraft stable and steerable in pitch/roll/yaw.”
  - Why it mattered (one-liner): “Control turned flight from a stunt into something repeatable and improvable.”
  - Prompt: “If you had power but no control, would you call it real flying?”

- **Jets / turbine era (mid-1900s → today)**
  - Example story: “Jet engines (gas turbines) made it possible to fly much faster and higher. That changed travel—suddenly crossing continents and oceans became routine.”
  - Why it mattered (one-liner): “Turbines scaled aviation up: speed, altitude, range, and carrying lots of people.”
  - Prompt: “What jobs become possible when you can go higher and faster?”

### Optional alternates (if you want different ‘3’)

- **First solo transatlantic flight (1927, Charles Lindbergh):** showed long-range navigation/endurance mattered; accelerated public interest.
- **First practical helicopter era (1939–1940s, Igor Sikorsky):** hover + vertical access changed rescue/utility missions.
- **Radar + ATC growth (1930s–1950s):** helped aircraft fly safely in busy skies and bad weather; enabled airline-scale operations.

Optional alternates:
- Radio navigation and instrument flying
- Radar and air traffic control systems
- Materials advances (aluminum, composites)

## 0:30–0:40 – Fixed wing vs rotary wing

### Core differences

- **Fixed-wing:** wing creates lift as air flows over it; requires forward motion; efficient for distance.
- **Rotary-wing:** rotor blades create lift by spinning; can hover; great for access; typically less efficient per mile.

### Optional pacing (fills the full 10 minutes)

- **0:30–0:32 – Hook: “Which would you choose?” (2 min)**
  - Scenario A: “You need to deliver supplies 300 miles away.”
  - Scenario B: “You need to rescue someone from a small clearing.”
  - Have scouts vote: fixed-wing or rotary-wing, then ask “Why?”

- **0:32–0:36 – Compare in 3 buckets (4 min)**
  - **How lift is made:** wing moving through air vs rotor blades acting like rotating wings.
  - **What it’s best at:** efficiency/range vs hover/precision access.
  - **Tradeoffs:** speed/range vs complexity/efficiency-per-mile.

- **0:36–0:39 – Quick classification game (3 min)**
  - Call out an aircraft/mission; scouts answer “fixed” or “rotary” and give one reason.
  - Prompts you can use:
    - News helicopter covering traffic (rotary; hover/slow)
    - Airline to another state (fixed; efficiency)
    - Crop dusting / aerial application (fixed; low-level coverage)
    - Powerline inspection near obstacles (rotary; slow/precise)
    - Medevac from a car crash scene (rotary; access)
    - Firefighting airtanker (fixed; speed/coverage)

- **0:39–0:40 – One-sentence recap (1 min)**
  - “Fixed-wing is usually best for going far efficiently; rotary-wing is best for hovering and tight access.”

### Benefits to emphasize

- Fixed-wing benefits: efficiency, speed, simpler mechanics (generally), range.
- Rotary-wing benefits: hover, vertical takeoff/landing, low-speed control.

### Common misconception to address

- “Helicopters don’t need lift like airplanes.”
  - They still produce lift; it’s just produced by rotor blades.

### Extra misconceptions (if questions come up)

- “Helicopters can just go straight up forever.” → Hover power is limited; heavier loads and hot/high conditions reduce hover capability.
- “Helicopters don’t stall.” → They don’t stall the same way as wings, but rotor blades can stall and there are other low-speed/low-power hazards.

## 0:40–0:52 – Engines overview (piston, turbine, jet)

### Optional pacing (fills ~12 minutes)

- **0:40–0:41 – Frame the question (1 min)**
  - “Engines answer: how do we turn fuel into thrust?”
  - “Today: piston, turbine, and ‘jet’ (as a thrust style).”

- **0:41–0:48 – Three engines, one memorable picture each (7 min)**
  - Piston: “car engine turning a propeller.”
  - Turbine: “windmill-in-reverse: hot gas spins turbine blades.”
  - Jet/turbofan: “big fan accelerates a lot of air backward.”

- **0:48–0:51 – Match the engine to the mission (3 min)**
  - Ask: “Training airplane? Helicopter? Airliner?”
  - Have scouts justify with one word: “simple,” “power,” “efficient,” “fast,” “reliable.”

- **0:51–0:52 – Quick check (1 min)**
  - “Is a turboprop a turbine engine or a prop engine?” (Answer: turbine engine family; it spins a prop.)

### Piston engine (with propeller)

- Similar concept to a car engine: cylinders, combustion, crankshaft.
- Typically drives a propeller.
- Common in trainers and small general aviation aircraft.

### Turbine engine (turboprop or turboshaft)

- Hot gases spin turbine blades.
- Turboprop: turbine spins a propeller.
- Turboshaft: turbine provides shaft power (common in helicopters).

### Jet (turbofan/turbojet)

- Produces thrust by accelerating air backward.
- Turbofan is the most common for airliners (efficiency at high speed/altitude).

### Consistency note

- You can keep “turbine vs jet” simple:
  - Turbine is the engine family; “jet” describes how thrust is produced.

### Common misconceptions to address

- “Jet engines are just rockets.” → Jets need air; rockets carry their own oxidizer.
- “Bigger engine always means faster.” → Airframe design and drag matter; engines have different goals (efficiency vs speed).

## 0:52–1:05 – Four forces of flight (model-based)

### Optional pacing (fills ~13 minutes)

- **0:52–0:54 – Set the four-force vocabulary (2 min)**
  - Have scouts repeat: “Lift, weight, thrust, drag.”
  - Ask: “Which two are up/down? Which two are forward/back?”

- **0:54–0:59 – Demo + predict (5 min)**
  - Use paper airplane/glider.
  - Ask before each throw: “More thrust or more drag? What happens?”
  - After: “What changed first—speed, climb, or distance?”

- **0:59–1:03 – ‘Force arrows’ activity (4 min)**
  - On the board, draw a simple airplane dot.
  - Have scouts place/describe arrows for lift/weight/thrust/drag.
  - Then ask: “What arrow gets bigger if we add flaps? What arrow gets bigger if we slow down?”

- **1:03–1:05 – Wrap + tie-forward (2 min)**
  - “Pilots manage all four forces with power, pitch/angle-of-attack, and configuration.”
  - Bridge to next section: “Next: what is lift and why does it change so fast near a stall?”

### The four forces

- **Lift:** upward force produced by wings/rotors.
- **Weight:** downward force from gravity.
- **Thrust:** forward force from prop/jet/rotor system (or component of rotor thrust).
- **Drag:** backward force from air resistance.

### How to explain equilibrium

- In steady, level flight:
  - Lift ≈ Weight
  - Thrust ≈ Drag

### Demo guidance

- Use a paper airplane or glider.
- Ask: “What happens if we increase thrust?” (speed increases; lift and drag change)
- Ask: “What happens if we increase drag?” (need more thrust or slow down)

### Common misconception

- “Lift always equals weight.” Only in steady, level flight.

### Extra quick questions (if you need a 60–90 second buffer)

- “On takeoff, which force increases first: thrust or lift?” (Thrust increases first; lift follows as speed builds.)
- “On landing, why do we add drag on purpose?” (To slow down and descend safely without gaining speed.)

---

## 1:05–1:15 – Lift and airfoils (Bernoulli + downwash)

### What to cover

- Lift comes from a combination of:
  - Pressure differences (air moving faster over parts of the wing can mean lower pressure)
  - Deflecting air downward (downwash); the reaction pushes the wing upward

### Bernoulli’s principle (simple)

- Faster-moving fluid tends to have lower pressure.
- Keep it qualitative; avoid equations.

### Angle of attack (AOA)

- Mention that lift depends on angle of attack and speed.
- Safety tie-in: too high AOA can cause a stall.
- **Define stall (scout-friendly):** a stall is when the wing’s airflow can’t stay smoothly attached because the angle of attack is too high, so lift drops a lot and drag increases. The airplane can still be flying (moving through the air), but the wing is no longer producing lift efficiently.
- **Critical angle of attack:** the specific AOA where the wing produces maximum lift; beyond this point the airflow separates and the wing stalls.
- **The “15–20° rule of thumb” (what you were thinking of):** many common wings stall at roughly **15–20 degrees AOA**, but it’s not a universal rule. The exact critical AOA depends on wing shape/airfoil, flaps, ice/contamination, and how the aircraft is loaded.
- **Important coaching point:** stalls are caused by **AOA**, not “being too slow” by itself—slower speed just makes it easier to reach a high AOA if you try to hold altitude.

### Demo guidance

- Paper-strip demo: blow across the top; the strip rises.

### Key phrasing for consistency

- “Wings create lift by changing airflow and pressure and by pushing air downward.”

---

## 1:15–1:27 – Control surfaces and aircraft attitude

### Attitude axes (quick)

- Pitch (nose up/down)
- Roll (bank left/right)
- Yaw (nose left/right)

### Surfaces to identify

- **Ailerons → roll**
- **Elevator → pitch**
- **Rudder → yaw**

Optional add-ons (if time or questions):
- Flaps (increase lift/drag for takeoff/landing)
- Trim (reduces control pressure)

### Coordination concept

- Turns are usually coordinated: bank (ailerons) + appropriate rudder.

---

## 1:27–1:35 – Instruments in a typical single-engine aircraft

### What to cover (purpose + what it tells you)

- Attitude indicator: aircraft orientation relative to horizon
- Heading indicator: stable heading display
- Altimeter: height (pressure-based)
- Airspeed indicator: speed through the air
- Turn and bank: rate of turn + coordination
- Vertical speed indicator: climb/descent rate
- Compass: magnetic direction reference
- Navigation (GPS/VOR, etc.): where you are and where you’re going
- Communication: radios to talk to ATC/other aircraft
- Engine performance: RPM, oil pressure/temp, fuel, EGT/CHT (varies)

### Teaching note

- Emphasize that pilots cross-check multiple instruments.

---

## 1:35–1:40 – Wrap-up and next steps

### Key close-out points

- Preview Session 2: safety-first drone/model flight + logs.
- If using drone option: ask scouts to complete TRUST before Session 2 and bring proof.

### Optional Requirement 5 preview (only if ahead)

- Introduce the idea of a pathway:
  - Student → Private → Instrument rating → Commercial → ATP
  - Remote pilot certificate for certain drone work

---

## Optional: troubleshooting/pacing

- If you’re behind, shorten the history section and keep more time for four forces, lift, controls, and instruments.
- If attention is drifting, move into the hands-on demos earlier and teach from the demo.
