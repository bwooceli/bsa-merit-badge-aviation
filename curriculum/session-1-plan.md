# Aviation Merit Badge – Session 1 Plan (90 minutes)

Audience: middle school to early high school

Primary target: Requirement 1 (Aviation Basics & Mechanics of Flight)
Stretch target (if time): start Requirement 5 overview (certificates + careers)

## Materials (prep)

- Whiteboard/markers
- Projector (optional) for images/videos
- Paper for paper-airplane folds (1–2 sheets per scout)
- 12–24 strips of paper (1 inch wide, ~10 inches long) for lift demo
- Small foam glider or model airplane (1–2) OR printed airplane diagram
- A printed “instrument panel” worksheet (see handouts)
- Tape measure (optional) for quick throw-distance demo
- Handouts (print):
  - `handouts/req-1-flight-basics-handout.md`
  - (optional) `handouts/req-5-opportunities-handout.md` (only if you reach Req 5)

## Safety and expectations (say out loud)

- No throwing paper airplanes until told.
- Keep models below head height.
- Ask questions—aviation is full of new vocabulary.

## 0:00–0:10 (10 min) – Icebreaker + expectations

Quick round-robin (keep it moving):
- Name, school/grade
- “If you could fly any aircraft—what would you pick?”
- “Have you flown in a small plane, helicopter, or drone?”

Set the tone:
- Today: what aircraft are, how flight works, and what pilots see in the cockpit.
- Next week: hands-on model aircraft/drone flight to work on Requirement 2.

## 0:10–0:20 (10 min) – What counts as an aircraft?

Board prompt: “What makes something an aircraft?”

Facilitate to a simple definition:
- An aircraft is a machine that can fly by being supported by the air (usually by generating lift or using rotor thrust).

Mini-activity (pairs, 2 minutes):
- List 3 aircraft you’ve seen in real life.

Quick share-out + categorize:
- Fixed-wing airplane (transport, training, cargo)
- Rotary-wing helicopter (medical, rescue, lifting)
- “Other” aircraft (gliders, balloons, drones, jets)

## 0:20–0:30 (10 min) – A tiny history of flight (3 moments)

Goal: scouts can name and explain 3 notable milestones.

Suggested “3 moments” (choose ones you like):
- Lighter-than-air: balloons/dirigibles (first sustained human flight)
- Wright brothers era: controlled powered flight (control + propulsion)
- Jets + modern aviation: turbine engines enabling high speed/altitude

Optional quick engagement:
- “What invention made long-distance flight practical?” (reliable engines, navigation, weather, runways)

## 0:30–0:40 (10 min) – Fixed wing vs rotary wing

Use the model/glider and simple gestures.

Key contrasts to cover:
- Fixed wing: lift from wings moving through air; efficient; needs forward motion/runway (usually)
- Rotary wing: lift from spinning blades; can hover; great for point-to-point; more complex/energy-intensive

Micro-check:
- “Which one can hover? Which is more efficient for long distance?”

## 0:40–0:52 (12 min) – Engines overview: piston vs turbine vs jet

Keep it conceptual (no deep thermodynamics).

- Piston/prop: like a car engine turning a propeller (common in trainers)
- Turbine: spins with hot gases; can drive a propeller (turboprop) or make thrust (turbojet/turbofan)
- Jet (everyday term): usually a turbofan producing thrust

Prompt questions:
- Why do big airliners mostly use turbofans?
- Why do many small training planes use piston engines?

## 0:52–1:05 (13 min) – The 4 forces of flight (hands-on)

Use a paper airplane for a simple demo.

Teach + draw:
- Lift (up)
- Weight (down)
- Thrust (forward)
- Drag (back)

Guided discussion:
- What changes lift? (speed, wing shape/angle, air density)
- What changes drag? (shape, speed, surface)

Quick activity:
- Scouts fold a simple paper airplane.
- On the handout, label the 4 forces with arrows.

## 1:05–1:15 (10 min) – How an airfoil generates lift (Bernoulli + angle of attack)

Do the “paper strip lift” demo:
- Hold a strip under your bottom lip and blow across the top; strip rises.

Explain simply:
- Faster airflow over a surface tends to reduce pressure.
- Wings also deflect air downward; the reaction pushes the wing upward.

Keep the wording scout-friendly:
- Lift is the result of pressure differences + pushing air downward.

## 1:15–1:27 (12 min) – Control surfaces (and what they do)

Pick one aircraft (a trainer airplane is easiest). Cover:
- Ailerons: roll
- Elevator: pitch
- Rudder: yaw
- Trim: reduces control pressure

Mini-demo:
- Hold paper airplane: show roll/pitch/yaw using your hand.

## 1:27–1:35 (8 min) – Cockpit instruments (labeling exercise)

Use the instrument panel worksheet:
- Identify “basic six” and what each tells the pilot
- Add navigation/communication and engine indicators at a high level

## 1:35–1:40 (5 min) – Wrap-up + next steps

- Collect any incomplete handouts (or let scouts keep them and bring back).
- Homework (optional but helpful for Session 2):
  - If you plan to do the drone option for Requirement 2, ask scouts to complete FAA TRUST beforehand (bring certificate).
  - Choose one aviation career you’re curious about and write 3 questions.

## If you finish early (optional Req 5 preview)

5-minute “pilot certificates ladder” preview:
- Student → private → instrument rating → commercial → ATP; mention remote pilot certificate for drones.

Then point them to the Req 5 handout for next week/follow-up.
