# Aviation Merit Badge – Session 2 Plan (90 minutes)

Primary target: Requirement 2 (Principles of Flight) – drone option
Secondary target: finish any missing parts of Requirement 1; start/continue Requirement 5 discussion

This session is designed for a single instructor and 1 (or more) drones.
All instructor-led content happens before going outside to fly.

Instructor references:
- `instructor-notes/instructor-guide-session-2-drone.md`
- `instructor-notes/instructor-guide-session-2-requirement-5.md` (optional module)

## Pre-session message to scouts (send ahead)

- Bring your FAA TRUST completion certificate (drone option).
- Wear closed-toe shoes.
- If you get motion-sick easily, tell the counselor before drone time.

Optional but recommended pre-work (10–20 minutes at home):
- Complete the TRUST certificate (required to fly under this option).
- Read and fill out sections A–C of `handouts/req-2-drone-safety-flight-log.md`.
- Skim `handouts/req-5-opportunities-handout.md` and choose one aviation career you might want to research.

## Materials (prep)

- Drone(s) with spare batteries, props, prop guards (recommended)
- Charging plan + power strip
- Cones or floor tape to create a flight box
- Printed handouts:
  - `handouts/req-2-drone-safety-flight-log.md`
  - `handouts/req-5-opportunities-handout.md` (if you cover Req 5 in class)
- A “no-fly” boundary map of the room/field (simple sketch on board is fine)
- First-aid kit

## Choose your flight location

- Best: outdoor field with clear boundaries, away from crowds/roads.
- Acceptable: large indoor gym (only if allowed and safe).

## 0:00–0:10 (10 min) – Welcome + quick recap

- One-minute recap: 4 forces, control surfaces, lift basics.
- Preview: today is “principles of flight in action” + career pathways.

## 0:10–0:22 (12 min) – Drone safety briefing + roles

Use the Req 2 handout’s checklist.

Cover (simple, high-value rules):
- Maintain visual line of sight (VLOS)
- Don’t fly over people
- Keep a safe buffer zone
- No “stunts” in merit badge setting
- Stop immediately if anyone enters the flight box

Assign roles that rotate as each scout flies:
- Pilot (hands on controller)
- Visual observer (calls out hazards, altitude, boundaries)
- Safety marshal (watches the perimeter)
- Recorder (logs each attempt)

## 0:22–0:30 (8 min) – TRUST check + setup

- Verify each scout’s TRUST certificate (or note who needs to finish).
- Explain: the goal is safe takeoff, controlled flight, and safe landing.

If anyone lacks TRUST:
- They can participate as observer/recorder today and fly only after completing TRUST.

## 0:30–0:45 (15 min) – Instructor-led “how to fly” briefing (indoors)

Goal: everyone understands the controls and what a “successful flight” looks like before you walk outside.

Cover:
- Controls: throttle, yaw, pitch, roll (and what each does)
- Why drones drift (wind, over-correction) and how to fix it (small inputs + pause)
- Standard callouts: “taking off”, “landing”, “abort”, “clear”
- What counts as success for the merit badge setting:
  - Safe takeoff
  - Controlled hover for a few seconds (or a slow simple maneuver)
  - Safe landing in the box

Optional quick preview (if you want to touch Requirement 5 in class):
- TRUST (recreational) vs remote pilot certificate (Part 107) for some work

## 0:45–0:55 (10 min) – Walk to flight area + set boundaries

- Walk time (adjust as needed for your site).
- On arrival, mark the flight box with cones/tape.
- Review “no-fly” boundaries and where observers stand.
- Do a single group preflight check (props, battery, link, area clear).

## 0:55–1:25 (30 min) – Flight time (one instructor, rotating roles)

Run a single flight line with everyone behind the boundary.

Suggested cadence (for 12 scouts):
- ~2 minutes per pilot (takeoff → hover → land)
- Rotate roles each pilot

Coaching priorities:
- Safety and calm control over “fancy flying”
- If a scout struggles, shorten the attempt to “hover 3–5 seconds then land”

If you have extra time or multiple drones:
- Give pilots a second attempt OR add a slow square/triangle pattern.

## 1:25–1:35 (10 min) – Walk back + sign-offs

- Walk back to the classroom.
- Counselor checks flight logs and notes completion status.

## 1:35–1:40 (5 min) – Close + follow-up opportunities

Explain your optional follow-ups:
- Airport visit / tower visit / ZKC ARTCC visit (as scheduling allows)

Ask scouts to:
- Pick one aviation career and complete the research section in the Req 5 handout.
- Bring questions for the follow-up meeting.

## Backup plan (if weather/drone fails)

Choose one Requirement 2 alternative to run indoors:
- FPG-9 paper glider build + landing accuracy contest
- Rubber-band balsa plane (if you have kits)

You can still use the same briefing → walk → flight-line approach.
